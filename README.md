# Customer-Analytics
- Determined customer sentiments by working with SAP and Biersdorf to process over 50,000 Amazon reviews of Nivea products across the USA-UK market. Implemented sentiment analysis to classify reviews into- positive, negative, neutral- & provided recommendations.

- Manipulated and concatenated 3 datasets for superior results. Used the Natural Language Toolkit to pre-process reviews by: removing stop-words, stemming, lemmatization and tokenization.

- Modeled reviews into 10 topics with a coherence score of 0.48, by employing the Latent Dirichlet allocation algorithm. Visualized topics to derive insights from inter-topic distance & frequency of keywords per topic.

- Utilized the VADER module to perform sentiment analysis on each review as well as each sentence of each review to establish a topic vs sentiment relation. Defined a function to achieve a positive, negative or neutral sentiment score for each sentence.
